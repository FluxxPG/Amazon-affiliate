For students, both the MacBook Air and Dell XPS offer fantastic screens and all-day endurance. Your choice comes down to platform, campus portability, and software needs.

## What Matters

- Battery life beyond 12 hours keeps you lecture-ready.
- Comfortable keyboard and trackpad reduce fatigue.
- Weight under 1.4 kg makes a real difference across a semester.

## Our Take

If you use Final Cut or prefer iOS integration, the Air is seamless. If you need Windows apps or upgradability, the XPS is flexible.
